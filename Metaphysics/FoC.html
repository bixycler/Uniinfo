<h1>The FoC (Form ∘ Content)</h1>
<p>
  <a href="Trinion.html">The Trinion</a> (\(\Trinion\)) is not an inanimate-insensate thing, but an <i>alive being with its static (◯), dynamic (↑) and balance (=)</i>. However, <i><b>looking back at itself</b></i>, the Trinion cannot see all of its components at once, but only some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction" target="_">abstraction</a> of itself.

<h3>Analysis of the Trinion</h3>
<p>
  The Trinion uses the Equal (=) as an eye to look, so it can see anything except its eye. Thus, the Equal (=) is first abstracted and the Trinion sees its body as an animate object but insensate due to the lack of the sensor, the eye. When the Trinion takes snapshot of its <i><b>form</b> as a static Circle (◯)</i>, the dynamic (↑) is abstracted, too. Thus, the form is just an abstract concept of an inanimate-insensate thing, captured by the symbol Circle (◯). After many snapshots, the Trinion connects them into a sequence, then abstracts the form out to infer its <i><b>content</b> as a static Arrow (↑)</i>. Thus, the animate content of the Trinion is captured by an inanimate symbol Arrow (↑). Finally, the Trinion reasons about the relation between what it has seen to draw the conclusion «◯ = ↑», then abstracts the two known symbols Circle (◯) and Arrow (↑) out to infer that its <i><b>operator</b> is the Equal (=)</i>. Thus, the sensate[<a href="#SensateSentientConscious">1</a>] operator of the Trinion is captured by an insensate symbol Equal (=). The operator is also denoted by symbol Composition (∘) and also called "<b>observer</b>". That's how the Trinion considers Circle (◯), Arrow (↑) and Equal (=) as abstract form, abstract content and abstract operator, respectively.

<h3>Integration of the components</h3>
<p>
  Using the operator (∘), the Trinion can only directly see its insensate body, so it consider <i>anything with form (◯), content (↑) and <b>without operator (∘)</b> as an <b>object</b></i>, in contrast to <i><b>subject</b> as anything <b>including all the three</b>, form (◯), content (↑) and operator (∘)</i>. However, due to <a href="Trinion.html#Intrinsics">the intrinsics of Unïnfo</a>, all concrete things are subjects because they always have all the three components even if some compopents are hidden. That means in the wholistic view, <b>concrete form</b>, <b>concrete content</b> and <b>concrete operator</b> are all subjects in their own right. Especially, the concrete operator (●), as the mind of its subject, can be considered as a "subject within subject" when the outer subject looks inside via self-reflection. The concrete operator has its own form and content to reflect the external world, in observation phase, into its internal world containing virtual objects, which will then be actualized into new real objects back in the external world, in operation phase. Hence, that internal world is called "<b>possible world</b>", those virtual objects are called "<b>extensional objects</b>", extending the observed objects in the actual world into the possible world.

<h3>Onion structure of the Trinion</h3>
<center><img src="img/Trinion-onion.png" width="150"></center>
<p>
  There are many <i>layers of form</i>, one after another, containing their contents inside. For each layer of form, there are two kinds of contents, the <b>self-content</b> which has crystalized into the form itself, and the <b>carried contents</b> which are inner layers enclosed by this layer. The self-content of adjacent layers are <i>separated by the extremes (±∞)</i>, thus <i>independent</i> from each other. Just like a bottle of water, both water (its carried contents, ⥁) and melted glass (its self-content, ⇌) are dynamic relative to the static glass bottle (its form, ◯). Back to the onion, at its base, there is a bud generating all those layers above, which has the potential to generate new layers in the future, that's the <b>concrete operator</b> of the Trinion, just like the seed of seed plants and the brain of animals.

<h3>Apendix</h3>
<h4>A. Terminology</h4>
<ul>
<li id="SensateSentientConscious"><b>Sensate</b>: Here we describe the ability of a subject to sense objects with the adjective <i>"sensate" as the most basic sensing capability</i>. When subjects become more complicated, their more sophisticated capacity of sensing can be described with "sentient" and "conscious".
