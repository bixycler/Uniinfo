<h1>The FoC (Form ∘ Content)</h1>
<p>
  <a href="Trinion.html">The Trinion</a> (\(\Trinion\)) is not an inanimate-insensate thing, but an <i><b>alive being</b> with its static (◯), dynamic (↑) and balance (=)</i>. 
  However, <i>as the Universe <b>looking back at itself</b></i>, the Trinion cannot see all of its components at once, but only some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction" target="_">abstraction</a> of itself.

<h3>Analysis of the Trinion</h3>
<p>
  The Trinion uses the Equal (=) as an eye to look, so it can see anything except its own eye. 
  Thus, the Equal (=) is first abstracted and the Trinion sees its body as an animate object but insensate due to the lack of the sensor (the eye). 
  When the Trinion takes snapshot of its <i><b>form</b> as a static Circle (◯)</i>, the dynamic (↑) is abstracted, too. 
  Thus, the form is just an abstract concept of an inanimate-insensate thing, captured by the symbol Circle (◯). 
  After many snapshots, the Trinion connects them into a sequence, then abstracts the form out to infer its <i><b>content</b> as a static Arrow (↑)</i>. 
  Thus, the animate content of the Trinion is captured by an inanimate symbol Arrow (↑). 
  Finally, the Trinion reasons about the relation between what it has seen to draw the conclusion ⟪◯ = ↑⟫, then abstracts the two known symbols Circle (◯) and Arrow (↑) out to infer that its <i><b>observer</b> is the Equal (=)</i>. 
  Thus, the sensate[<a href="#SensateSentientConscious">1</a>] observer of the Trinion is captured by an insensate symbol Equal (=), which represents the sensor (the eye). 
  With the observed knowledge, the Trinion <i>operates</i> its body according to the dynamic equation ⟪↑ ⇌ ◯⟫, where the Equal (⇌) tells the body how to take <i>action (↑)</i> to <i>transform (⇌◯)</i> itself. 
  Thus, the Equal is also called the “<i><b>operator</b></i>” of the Trinion and denoted by the <i>Composition symbol (∘)</i>, where ⟪↑ ∘ ◯⟫ is the operation of taking action (↑) on the form (◯) to transform it. 
  That's how the Trinion considers Circle (◯), Arrow (↑) and Equal (=) as <i>abstract form</i>, <i>abstract content</i> and <i>abstract operator</i>, respectively. 
  And in theory, we usually deal with those abstract things only, especially the variety of forms.

<h3>Integration and working of the components</h3>
<p>
  Using the observer (∘), the Trinion can only directly see its insensate body, so it considers <i>anything <b>without observer-operator (∘)</b> as an <b>object</b></i>, in contrast to <i><b>subject</b> as anything <b>including all the three</b>, form (◯), content (↑) and observer-operator (∘)</i>. 
  However, due to <a href="Trinion.html#Intrinsics">the intrinsics of Unïnfo</a>, all concrete things (beings) are subjects because they always have all the three components even if some compopents are hidden. 
  That means in the wholistic view, <i><b>concrete form</b>, <b>concrete content</b> and <b>concrete operator</b> are all subjects in their own right</i>. 
  Here, the term “<b>being</b>” is reserved for subjects, so the concrete thing of an abstract “X” will be called “X being”, like <i>“form being”, “content being”, “operator being”</i>. 
  Especially, the <b>operator being (●)</b>, as the mind of its subject, can be considered as a “subject within subject” when the outer subject looks inside via self-reflection. 
  As an observer, the operator being has its own form (the “eyeball”), with its own content (observing action), to reflect the external “real objects” (in the Trinion's body) into its “virtual objects” (in the eyeball) [perception], which interact with each other to generate new “virtual objects” [thinking] and to crystalize into new forms (the “knowledge”) of the being [conception].
  After that observation phase, comes the operation phase where the operator being uses its own forms (the “eyeball” and the observed “knowledge”) to actualize the new “virtual objects” into new “real objects” to transform the external body of the Trinion. 
  Hence, the term “operator” is used in subsumption of “observer”, where “observer” is an “inward operator” with observing action on the eyeball, and the normal “operator” is an “outward operator” acting on the external body of the Trinion.

<p>
  Moreover, the “virtual objects” are called “extensional objects”, or simply “<b>extensions</b>”, because they extend the “real objects” from one to many, and the collection of all extensional objects together with their relations make up the internal world called “<b>extension world</b>”. 
  The part of the extension world containing only objects reflecting the “real objects” outside is projected outward to be called the “<b>actual world</b>”. 
  Via transformation, the actual world can reach other parts of the extension world which are called “<b>possible worlds</b>”, where <i>the “actual world” is the “current possible world”</i>. The remaining part of the extension world comprises “impossible worlds” (purely imaginary worlds) and purely virtual objects called “concepts”.
  The forms of the operator being (“eyeball” and “knowledge”) together with the contents of the Trinion (“real objects”) make up the <b>intension</b> of the operator, whose extension is the extension world.

<h3>Onion structure of the Trinion</h3>
<center><img src="img/Trinion-onion.png" width="150"></center>
<p>
  There are many <i>layers of form</i>, one after another, containing their contents inside. For each layer of form, there are two kinds of contents, the <b>self content</b> which has crystalized into the form itself, and the <b>carried contents</b> which are inner layers enclosed by this layer. The self content of adjacent layers are <i>separated by the extremes (±∞)</i>, thus <i>independent</i> from each other. Just like a bottle of water, both water (its carried contents, ⥁) and melted glass (its self content, ⇌) are dynamic relative to the static glass bottle (its form, ◯). Back to the onion 🧅, at its base, there is a bud generating all those layers above, which has the potential to generate new layers in the future, that's the operator being of the Trinion, just like the seed of plants and the brain of animals.

<h4>A. Terminology</h4>
<ul>
<li id="SensateSentientConscious"><b>Sensate</b>: Here we describe the ability of a subject to sense objects with the adjective <i>“sensate” and the noun “sensation” as the most basic sensing capability</i>. When subjects become more complicated, their more sophisticated capacity of sensing can be described with “sentient” and “conscious”. The concrete subjects (●) that sense are called “observers/operators” and the abstract objects that sense, i.e. the Equal (=), are called “eyes/sensors”.
