<p>
  <a href="Trinion.html">The Trinion</a> (\(\Trinion\)) is not an inanimate object, but an alive being with its dynamic (↑) and balance (=). However, looking back at itself, the Trinion cannot see all of its components at once, but only some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction" target="_">abstraction</a> of itself.

  As the eye of a subject, the Equal (=) is first abstracted so that the Trinion sees its body as an <i><b>object</b> composed of the Circle (◯) and the Arrow (↑)</i>. Abstracting the dynamic (↑), the Trinion takes "snapshot" of its <i><b>form</b> as a static Circle (◯)</i>. After many snapshots, it connects them into a sequence then further abstracts the form to infer its <i><b>content</b> as a static Arrow (↑)</i>. Finally, it reasons about the relation between what it has seen to draw the conclusion «◯ = ↑», then abstracts the two known symbols Circle (◯) and Arrow (↑) to infer that its <i><b>operator</b> is the Equal (=)</i>.

<li id="Differentiation"><b>Postulate of Differentiation</b>: There exists an Arrow (↑) different from the Circle.</li>
<li id="Unification"><b>Postulate of Unification</b>: The Circle and the Arrow are two aspects of a united body via the Equal (=)[<a href="#EqualVsEquals">4</a>].</li>
