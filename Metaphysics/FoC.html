<h1>The FoC (Form ∘ Content)</h1>
<p>
  <a href="Trinion.html">The Trinion</a> (\(\Trinion\)) is not an inanimate-insensate thing, but an <i>alive being called "<b>subject</b>" with its static (◯), dynamic (↑) and balance (=)</i>. However, looking back at itself, the Trinion cannot see all of its components at once, but only some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction" target="_">abstraction</a> of itself.

  As the eye of the subject, the Equal (=) is first abstracted so that the Trinion sees its body as an <i><b>object</b> composed of the Circle (◯) and the Arrow (↑)</i>. While the object is still animate, it's insensate due to the lack of the sensor, the eye, the Equal (=). When the Trinion takes "snapshot" of its <i><b>form</b> as a static Circle (◯)</i>, the dynamic (↑) is abstracted. Thus the form is just an abstract concept of an inanimate-insensate thing, captured by the symbol Circle (◯). After many snapshots, the Trinion connects them into a sequence then further abstracts the form to infer its <i><b>content</b> as a static Arrow (↑)</i>. Thus, the animate content of the object is captured by an inanimate symbol Arrow (↑). Finally, the Trinion reasons about the relation between what it has seen to draw the conclusion «◯ = ↑», then abstracts the two known symbols Circle (◯) and Arrow (↑) to infer that its <i><b>operator</b> is the Equal (=)</i>. Thus the sensate operator of the subject is captured by an insensate symbol Equal (=).

<p>
  Studying about each component of itself, the Trinion realizes that they are all subjects in their own right. So, the component subjects are called "concrete form", "concrete content" and "concrete operator" to distinguish from the abstract concepts of them as described above.

<p>
  Operator = meta object, the seed to generate new subject, denoted by symbol "∘". The Trinion manifests as the FoC.
