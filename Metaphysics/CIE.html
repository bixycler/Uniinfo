<h1>The CIE (Ψ)</h1>
<p>“CIE” is pronouced /saɪ/ or /si/ whichever rhymes with the Greek letter “Ψ”.

While the three components of <a href="Trinion.html">the Trinion</a> (◯, ↑, =) show the objective and qualitative structure of the Universe, the Trinion itself observes the Universe via the <i>subjective and quantitative</i> operator of <a href="FoC.html">the FoC</a>. The <i><b>operator being (●)</b></i> works with the following three components:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Content (<i>c</i>):</b> This is the object to be observed and measured, the measuree, the domain of operation, the unknown amount of material.</li>
<li><b>Intent (<i>i</i>):</b> This is the subject that measure the object, the measurer, the measuring unit, the container of content, the operator, the known amount of material. In perception, it's the “eye's self”, the projector that projects the material object onto the mental world. The operation of measuring or projecting the unknown (<i>c</i>) against the known (<i>i</i>) is illustrated by the division <i>c/i</i>.</li>
<li><b>Extent (<i>e</i>):</b>  This is the number as the result of measurement, the rage of the operation, the image of projection. This number is non-material and purely a mental construction by the intent.</li>
</ul>
<p>There, “CIE” stands for “<i>content/intent = extent</i>” or “<i>content = intent × extent</i>”. 
</p>
<p>In dualistic view, these three components are 2-1 divided rotationally in three partitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Intension (<i>c</i>, <i>i</i>) - Extension (<i>e</i>):</b> 
In the mapping (projection) <i>c →<sub>i</sub> e</i>, the source <i>c</i> and the mapper <i>i</i> constitute its intension, and the image <i>e</i> is its extension. While the traditional definition of intention - extension is <i>predicative</i> in that it assumes a predefined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse" target="_blank">domain of discourse</a> (the set “U”), the definition here takes the domain <i>c</i> into account, hence <b><i>constructive</i></b>. Because the predicative approach treats intension as <i>constraint</i> against the predefined domain, the smaller the intension the larger the extension (inverse variation). Meanwhile, the constructive approach here treat intension as the <i>building blocks</i> (both domain and constraint) of mapping, thus the extension usually increases together with the intension, just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_extension" target="_">group extension</a>. Because of the non-material property of the extent, this is also called the “<b>Material (<i>c</i>, <i>i</i>) - Mental (<i>e</i>)</b>” partition.
</li>
<li><b>Form (<i>i</i>, <i>e</i>) - Content (<i>c</i>):</b> 
In the projection <i>i: c → e</i>, the <i>intensional form</i> of the <b>eye <i>i</i></b> defines the <i>format</i> for the content <i>c</i>, so that <i>c</i> appears to the eye in the <i>extensional form e</i>. While in philosophy and science, “form” usually refers to the format, formular (intensional form), in natural language, “form” usually refers to the shape (extensional form). Here, the two forms are united to contrast with the content. Because the intensional form of the eye is especially important and the pronunciation of letter “i” is the same as the word “eye”, “i” is usually used to denote the eye of projection, where it can also means “I, the subject of projection”. Because the intensional form <i>i</i> represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self" target="_blank">self</a>, the subject, this partition is also called the “<b>M(<i>i</i>, <i>e</i>) - W(<i>c</i>)</b>” (“Mine vs Wild”, or “Me vs World”) partition, or the “<i>Mirror partition</i>”. 
</li>
<li><b>Extensive (<i>e</i>, <i>c</i>) - Intensive (<i>i</i>):</b> 
In the projective function <i>i: c → e</i> (<i>c/i = e</i>), the variables (dependent <i>e</i> &amp; independent <i>c</i>) are extensive properties, the parameter <i>i</i> is an intensive property. Inversely, the content <i>c</i> may be considered as a function of intent <i>i</i> and extent <i>e</i> (<i>c = i·e</i>), where the role of dependent-independent variables are reversed. This partition is derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties" target="_blank">physical properties</a>. In the subjective view of the projector (<i>i</i>), it's also the “<b>Variant (<i>e</i>, <i>c</i>) - Invariant (<i>i</i>)</b>” partition. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Actually, the name of the three components are taken from the fewer side of each partition. Because these partitions are interleaving, care must be taken not to confuse between a component and a class, eg. “intent” vs. “intension” (including both “intent” and “content”).
</p>

<h3>Relation with the Trinion</h3>
<p>
The intent (i) is the micro circle, AKA the “self”, which creates the projection arrow c → e via the equal between c/i and e. <br>
View-control, proj-action, div/mul: “c/i” = “view c with the eye i”; “i⋅e” = “operator i acts on e” <br>
Form - formation, place - displacement <br>
The macro circle “c/i/e = 0” is the Trinion with the eye in the middle.

<h3>The CIE in Unithread and Knowledge Theory</h3>
<p>
  View - proj = distortion = curve = force<br>
rotate = refect<br>
self-reflect: i = c/e

This Greek letter, psi, is not only pronounced similar to “cie”, but also composed of all three capitalized letters “C, I, E”.

<h4>B. Vietnamese terms</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extent - intent: kích thước - hàm thức </li>
<li>Intension - extension: nội hàm - ngoại diên </li>
<li>Extensive - intensive: phân tán (mở rộng) - tập trung </li>
<li>Extensity - intensity: độ phân tán - độ tập trung (độ dãn - độ nén) </li>
<li>Form - content: hình thức - nội dung </li>
<li>Hình thức = ngoại hình + hàm thức </li>
<li>Nội hàm = nội dung + hàm thức </li>
<li>Thuộc tính mở rộng: nội dung, kích thước (ngoại diên) </li>
<li>Nội dung = hàm thức × kích thước </li>
<li>Function = hàm: The old meaning of “<i>function as a container of variables and parameters</i>” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept" target="_blank">Bernoulli 1718, Euler 1748</a>), as captured by the Sino-Vietnamese term “hàm” [函], is retrieved here in the partition “extensive - intensive”. The modern meaning of “function as a mapping” was introduced by Dirichlet in 1837. </li>
