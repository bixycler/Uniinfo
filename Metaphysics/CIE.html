<h1>The CIE (Ψ)</h1>
<p>“CIE” is pronouced /saɪ/ or /si/ whichever rhymes with the Greek letter “Ψ”.

While the three components of <a href="Trinion.html">the Trinion</a> (◯, ↑, =) show the objective and qualitative structure of the Universe, the Trinion itself observes the Universe via the <i>subjective and quantitative</i> operator of <a href="FoC.html">the FoC</a>. The <i><b>operator being (●)</b></i> works with the following three components:
</p>
<ul class="definition">
<li><b>Content (<i>c</i>):</b> This is the object to be observed and measured, the measuree, the domain of operation, the unknown amount of material.</li>
<li><b>Intent (<i>i</i>):</b> This is the subject that measures the object, the measurer, the measuring unit, the container of content, the operator, the known amount of material. In perception, it's the “eye's self”, the projector that projects the material object onto the mental world. The operation of measuring or projecting the unknown (<i>c</i>) against the known (<i>i</i>) is illustrated by the division <i>c/i</i>.</li>
<li><b>Extent (<i>e</i>):</b>  This is the number resulting from the measurement, the rage of the operation, the image of projection. This number is non-material and purely a mental construction by the intent.</li>
</ul>
<p>There, “CIE” stands for “<i>content/intent = extent</i>” or “<i>content = intent × extent</i>”. 
</p>
<p>In dualistic view, these three components are 2-1 divided rotationally in three partitions:
</p>
<ul class="definition">
<li><b>Sustent (<i>c</i>, <i>i</i>) - Extent (<i>e</i>):</b> 
In the mapping <i>i: c → e</i>, the source <i>c</i> and the mapper <i>i</i> are the ones that determine the image <i>e</i> which, in its turn, extends both <i>c</i> and <i>i</i>. Thus, the ones that sustain are called “sustents” (<i>c</i>, <i>i</i>) and the one that extends is called “extent” (<i>e</i>). Sustent is the invisible underlying substance of all things that are expressed in the mind of the subject as visible extents. Externally, the “content” <i>c</i> sustains the object, and internally, the “intent” <i>i</i> sustains the subject, so that mental images <i>e</i> can be constructed to reflect the information of the content via the subject's eye. In this way, the partition “sustent - content” is also called the “<b>Physical (<i>c</i>, <i>i</i>) - Informational (<i>e</i>)</b>” or “material - mental” partition. The sustent is a full circle, i.e. the content and the intent complement each other. In objective view, the intent is the context of the content where the extent can be “comprehended”, and vice versa, the content is the context of the intent. 
</li>
<li><b>Form (<i>i</i>, <i>e</i>) - Content (<i>c</i>):</b> 
In the projection <i>c →<sub>i</sub> e</i>, the <i>internal form</i> <i>i</i> of the <b>eye</b> defines the <i>format</i> for the content <i>c</i>, so that <i>c</i> appears to the eye as the <i>external form e</i>. While in philosophy and science, “form” usually refers to the format, formular (internal form), in natural language, “form” usually refers to the shape (external form). Here, the two forms are united to contrast with the content. Because the internal form of the eye is especially important to the jubject and the pronunciation of letter “i” is the same as the word “eye”, “i” is usually used to denote the <i>eye of projection</i>, where it can also means “I, the subject of projection”. Because the internal form <i>i</i> represents the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self" target="_blank">self</a> of the subject, and the external form represents the image projected in the mind of the subject, this partition is also called the “<b>M(<i>i</i>, <i>e</i>) - W(<i>c</i>)</b>” (“Mine vs Wild”, or “Me vs World”) partition, or the “<i>Mirror partition</i>”. 
</li>
<li><b>Extensive (<i>e</i>, <i>c</i>) - Intensive (<i>i</i>):</b> 
In the observation function <i>e = ob<sub>i</sub>(c) = c/i</i> and the operation function <i>c = op<sub>i</sub>(e) = i⋅e</i>, the <i>variables</i> <i>e</i> &amp; <i>c</i> are extensive properties, while the <i>parameter</i> <i>i</i> is an intensive property, as in the categorization of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties" target="_blank">physical properties</a>. That means, in the subjective view of the observer-operator (<i>i</i>), it's the “<b>Variant (<i>e</i>, <i>c</i>) - Invariant (<i>i</i>)</b>” partition. Moreover, in maths and logic, the intension of an object is defined by <i>i</i> and its extension is the mapping of abstract objects denoted by the <i>abstract extension</i> <i>e</i> to concrete objects denoted by the <i>concrete extension</i> <i>c = i⋅e</i>. Most of the maths, logic, and information technology work with the abstract extension <i>e</i> only, which manifests as numbers, symbols, signs, sets, etc. Against a fixed content <i>c</i> of the Universe (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse" target="_blank">domain of discourse</a>), the inverse variation of intension <i>i</i> and extension <i>e</i> of predicates is shown in the identity <i>c/i = e</i>.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Actually, the name of the three components “content - intent - extent” are taken from the fewer side of each partition. Othwerwise, the triple (<i>c</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>e</i>) can be called “content - context - form”.

<h3>The CIE in Unithread and Knowledge Theory</h3>

  View - proj = distortion = curve = force<br>
rotation = flection (deflect, refect, multiflect)<br>
self-reflect: i = c/e<br>

This Greek letter, psi, is not only pronounced similar to “cie”, but also composed of all three capitalized letters “C, I, E”.

<h4>B. Vietnamese terms</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extent - intent: kích thước - hàm thức </li>
<li>Intension - extension: nội hàm - ngoại diên </li>
<li>Extensive - intensive: phân tán (mở rộng) - tập trung </li>
<li>Extensity - intensity: độ phân tán - độ tập trung (độ dãn - độ nén) </li>
<li>Form - content: hình thức - nội dung </li>
<li>Hình thức = ngoại hình + hàm thức </li>
<li>Nội hàm = nội dung + hàm thức </li>
<li>Thuộc tính mở rộng: nội dung, kích thước (ngoại diên) </li>
<li>Nội dung = hàm thức × kích thước </li>
<li>Function = hàm: The old meaning of “<i>function as a container of variables and parameters</i>” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept" target="_blank">Bernoulli 1718, Euler 1748</a>), as captured by the Sino-Vietnamese term “hàm” [函], is retrieved here in the partition “extensive - intensive”. The modern meaning of “function as a mapping” was introduced by Dirichlet in 1837. </li>
