<h1>The Triad (▲) of Unïnfo</h1>
<div>
<center><i>“The Way produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; Three produced all things.”</i><br/>
「道生一，一生二，二生三，三生萬物。」</center>
<div style="text-align: right;">— <a href="https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11633" target="_blank">Chapter 42. The transformations of the Way</a>, Dao De Jing, Lao Tzu</div>

<p>
In Unïnfo, everything is made of three components described in three postulates:
</p>
<h1><center>◯ = ↑</center></h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Postulate of Existence</b>: There exists a Circle (◯).</li>
<li><b>Postulate of Differentiation</b>: There exists an Arrow (↑) different from the Circle.</li>
<li><b>Postulate of Unification</b>: The Circle and the Arrow are two aspects of a united body via the Equal (=)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The equation “◯ = ↑” is the One that unifies the Two opposites (◯, ↑) via the Third (=). This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_of_opposites" target="_blank">the unity of opposites</a> (☯). The Circle, the Arrow and the Equal, respectively represents the <i>statics</i>, the <i>dynamics</i> and the <i>balances</i>. And their unity is shown in the following three intrinsics:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Intrinsic Static</b> 
    <ul>
    <li><b><i>“Every arrow is composed of circles</i> (⇴).”</b> <img src="img/Intrinsic static of arrow.png" style="float:right;" height=50> Just like a vehicle moving with its wheels, every change has its invariant(s), every motion has its law(s). The law of motion is invariant, the wheels of moving vehicle are invariant. Because they are invariants underlying the variants, they are called "intrinsic statics".</li>
    <li><b><i>“Every equal is in shape of circle</i> (⊜).”</b> <img src="img/Intrinsic static of equal - micro.png" style="float:right;" height=40> The most familiar equality is that two objects have the same form, or the same measure, or the same shape, etc. Those forms are the statics represented by circles.<br/> <img src="img/Intrinsic static of equal - macro.png" style="float:right;" height=20> The more subtle equality is that of the opposites, just like |-1234| = |+1234|. The opposites are "equal" because they are complement, together they comprise a whole which is represented by the Circle.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><b>Intrinsic Dynamic</b> </li>
    <ul>
    <li><b><i>“Every circle is composed of arrows</i> (⥁).”</b> <img src="img/Intrinsic dynamic of circle.gif" style="float:right;" height=50> Just like a spinning top, some object looks static because it's moving in circle, its motion is looping back, it's going back and forth (🗘).</li>
    <li><b><i>“Every equal is in shape of arrows</i> (⇌).”</b> The balance between things is always a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_equilibrium" target="_blank">dynamic equilibrium</a> where the exchange between them cancel out each other. For example, in mechanics, we have balance between force vectors, in chemistry, we have balance between reaction directions, etc.  </li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Intrinsic Balance</b> </li>
    <ul>
    <li><b>The macro balance of the whole (⊜):</b> <img src="img/Intrinsic balance - macro.png" style="float:right;" height=50> For each "this" there always exists a "that" to counterbalance. If we cannot find the counterbalance, it's hidden in the meta world, eg. when something is placed in an imbalanced position, there emerges a returning force as a meta to counterbalance. The parts can be imbalanced but the whole is always balanced. Another expression of the holistic balance is the cyclic order, eg. a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; a ⟹ a ~ b ~ c. However, to a selful eye, the wholistic balance can be difficult to see because the whole contains not only the visible but also the invisible, not only the objects but also the metas. So, to see the whole's balance, we must use a holistic eye.</li>
    <li><b>The micro balance of the selfless eye (⇌):</b> <img src="img/Intrinsic balance - micro.png" style="float:right;" height=30> In stead of extending the view to the whole, when we reduce the self to zero, just look at the contact point, the incidence point, we see the contacting parties always balance each other. </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
