<p>In Unithread, <a href="../Metaphysics/Trinion.html" target="_">the Trinion</a> is manifested as a “thread”, called “Ω-thread” [Ω] (Ōṁ-thread [Ω,ॐ], One-thread [Ω,𝟙], Omni-thread or Overall thread, Ouroboros thread), which is a closed directed dynamic metrizable refinable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_topology" target="_">topos</a>. Its dynamic content and direction embody the Arrow (↑), its closeness embodies the Circle (○), its metrizability and fefinability embody the Equal (=).
</p>
<p>From the outside, the Ω-thread is seen as just a 0 point without any information. Different eyes in the Ω-thread see different views of the Ω-thread with different structures and information.
</p>
<p>
  Abstract content -> + CIE (1 ○) = concrete content -> + FoC (2 ○) = time & demi-space -> + double FoC (3 ○) = space & time
</p>
<p>“current” = coarse-grained thread, “thread” = fine-grained current, compared to the resolution of the eye.
