While the three components of <a href="Triad.html">the Triad</a> (◯ = ↑) show the objective and qualitative structure of the Universe, in practice, we can only comprehend the world via <i>subjective and quantitative</i> means. Hence, we need another triad to analyze stuffs in Unïnfo. The three components of CIE are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Content (<i>c</i>):</b> This is the object to be measured and observed, the measuree, the domain of operation, the unknown amount of material.</li>
<li><b>Intent (<i>i</i>):</b> This is the subject that measure the object, the measurer, the measuring unit, the container of content, the operator, the known amount of material. In perception, it's the "eye's self", the projector that projects the material object onto the mental world. The operation of measuring or projecting the unknown (<i>c</i>) against the known (<i>i</i>) is illustrated by the division <i>c/i</i>.</li>
<li><b>Extent (<i>e</i>):</b>  This is the number as the result of measurement, the rage of the operation, the image of projection. This number is non-material and purely a mental construction by the intent.</li>
</ul>
<p>There, CIE (Ψ) stands for "<i>content/intent = extent</i>" or "<i>content = intent × extent</i>". 
</p>
<p>In dualistic view, these three components are 2-1 divided rotationally in three partitions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Intension (<i>c</i>, <i>i</i>) - Extension (<i>e</i>):</b> 
In the mapping (projection) <i>c →<sub>i</sub> e</i>, the source <i>c</i> and the mapper <i>i</i> constitute its intension, and the image <i>e</i> is its extension. While the traditional definition of intention - extension is <i>predicative</i> in that it assumes a predefined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse" target="_blank">domain of discourse</a> (the set "U"), the definition here takes the domain <i>c</i> into account, hence <b><i>constructive</i></b>. Because the predicative approach treats intension as <i>constraint</i> against the predefined domain, the smaller the intension the larger the extension (inverse variation). Meanwhile, the constructive approach here treat intension as the <i>building blocks</i> (both domain and constraint) of mapping, thus the extension usually increases together with the intension. Moreover, the intension is on the <i>material</i> side and the extension is on the <i>mental</i> side.
</li>
<li><b>Form (<i>i</i>, <i>e</i>) - Content (<i>c</i>):</b> 
The <i>intensional form</i> of the eye <i>i</i> defines the <i>format</i> for the content <i>c</i>, so that <i>c</i> appears in the <i>extensional form e</i>. The traditional predicative maths, logics and physics only deal with forms because the content is elusive and difficult to handle.
</li>
<li><b>Extensive (<i>e</i>, <i>c</i>) - Intensive (<i>i</i>):</b> 
The numerators <i>e</i> &amp; <i>c</i> are extensive properties (variables) while the denominator <i>i</i> is an intensive property (parameter). This partition shows up clearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties" target="_blank">in physics</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Actually, the name of the three components are taken from the fewer side of each partition. Because these partitions are interleaving, care must be taken not to confuse between a component and a class, eg. "intent" vs. "intension" (including both "intent" and "content").

A. About the symbol "Ψ": <img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQ6ABmYQuLzB63u_0hmw7ow80bpcBAxccuQ29IFJtJ2XaEQdvED2urKs0OE67JZaYMgFgWWYnmWKA4X/pub?w=334&amp;h=159" style="float:right;" height=60> <br/>
This Greek letter, psi, is not only pronounced similar to "cie", but also composed of all three capitalized letters "C, I, E".

B. Vietnamese terms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Extent - intent: kích thước - hàm thức </li>
<li>Intension - extension: nội hàm - ngoại diên </li>
<li>Extensive - intensive: phân tán (mở rộng) - tập trung </li>
<li>Extensity - intensity: độ phân tán - độ tập trung (độ dãn - độ nén) </li>
<li>Form - content: hình thức - nội dung </li>
<li>Hình thức = ngoại hình + hàm thức </li>
<li>Nội hàm = nội dung + hàm thức </li>
<li>Thuộc tính mở rộng: nội dung, kích thước (ngoại diên) </li>
<li>Nội dung = hàm thức × kích thước </li>
</ul>
