<h1>Projective Dynamics</h1>
<p>The self thread just flows steadily at constant speed c, the distortion produces all dynamics. Mass = condensed thread, P, F, E all result from distortion of thread. Gravity = stretched around the condensed.
</p>
<h2>Elastic Dynamics</h2>
<p>Spring, returning force
</p>
<h2>Newtonian Dynamics</h2>
<p>Exponential config, flow
</p>
<h2>Self Circle & Reflective Dynamics</h2>
<p>All self circles are equal. Each self is equivalent to the whole Universe, is just an image reflecting the Universe. Content of the Universe = self content = 1 = intent × extent = content of each instance (cell) of that self × number of instances.
</p>
<p>
    Each self constantly maintains its image of its world via the effect circle between Mine (self) and Wild (world). Each effect circle is a connection/link/relation between nodes in the uninet. The collection of relations between two selves is the projection between two images (reflections of the Universe). Each change (disturbance) of a node inits a wave of effects propagating throughout the uninet until equilibrium. Each self tries its best to eliminate any changes in its circle, and it reaches equilibrium when there's no apparent change, i.e. "static", "perfect circular", i.e. all changes are refined to zero intent like heat bath, i.e. all changes are shifted to orthogonal world (invisible to this self).
